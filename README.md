# IOD-Builder
Life made easier

<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this project is to improve the KEMET CCS building process by moving away from excel.<br/>
By removing excel we can improve the <b>performance and organization</b>. Also, it is much more user friendly to recreate <br/>
the macroes into a window application.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Current Problems</h2>
<ui>
<li>Currently, using a 3rd-party plugin that have very limited reading functionality
<li>Can't get the worksheet name</li>
<li>Still need to decide whether to hardcode the excel formulas0(easier) or make it read from a txt file(harder)</li>
</ui>
